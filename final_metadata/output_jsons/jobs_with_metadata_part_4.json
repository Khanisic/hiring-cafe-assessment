    "description": "Our department is responsible for efficiently distributing financial data from its source to interested users all around the world.  This includes (for example) stock prices or foreign exchange rates. Data can either be served in response to a request or streamed in real time. The group owns: the distribution software and infrastructure a range of different sources of data the supporting services to be able to administer and manage the system, including permissioning and metering The team is also responsible for the Enterprise endpoint (“B-PIPE”) which allows end-users to programmatically consume data via our SDK.  Data is also available through the Bloomberg Terminal or Microsoft Excel. The main challenge faced by the group is one of scale - data is sourced from more than 370 global exchanges with a combined volume in excess of 60 billion messages each day.  We deliver this data to hundreds of thousands of terminals and thousands of B-PIPEs.  Handling this volume takes a lot of hardware!  We manage multiple clusters in our main data centres as well a network of many thousands of servers all around the world. Team Overview The SRE group comprises three sub-teams: one in Tokyo, one in London and one in New York.  This allows us to provide on-call coverage following the sun.  This role is in the London team.  The mission of the group as a whole is to ensure our systems are reliable, scalable and observable by using software engineering practices. The group’s responsibilities fall under five main pillars: Latency Monitoring and Management Defining, measuring and viewing service level indicators (SLIs) for latency. Defining service level objectives (SLOs) for latency and alerting on breaches. Building tools to accurately and quickly identify the sources of latency. Capacity Management Ensuring all subsystems can scale horizontally. Maintaining sufficient capacity to withstand a disaster and demonstrating compliance. Building tools to understand the current utilisation and capacity of the system and predict the impact of load increases and new use cases. System Monitoring and Observability Building tools to detect problems proactively, before they are reported by customers. Providing information on the overall health of the system from a single, well-known, entry point. Putting alarms in place, with actionable run-books, for all critical issues. Production Risk Management Ensuring business-as-usual changes are safely released to production. Planning and / or executing the release of more complex changes. Reviewing and re-architecting the infrastructure to improve resiliency and performance. Incident Response Managing live incidents to diagnose and remediate issues, mitigating customer impact as quickly as possible. Building tools to diagnose issues and run manual operational responses safely and correctly. Provide automated responses to standard problems. The London team is currently responsible for two critical parts of the distribution system. First of all, we own the system which serves configuration to the thousands of servers in the distribution network and the B-PIPEs. These servers “call home” when they start up and the system has the responsibility for delivering the proper settings to them. The wide reach of this system means that correctness is extremely important. We also own the mechanism which allows servers to be grouped together in discoverable clusters of peers. This comprises a back-end service to query for peers and also the UI to manage the groupings. Changes to these systems often include developing business functionality, as well as technical enhancements. We have also built a framework to flexibly and regularly monitor our estate of servers to ensure that they are operating properly at all times. Finally, we also own the main tool used to diagnose data quality issues in the distribution network. Finally, in addition, the team also makes changes to other core subsystems (outside of our formal ownership) in order to improve the reliability of the wider system. All of this gives us a very strong focus on software development in addition to our operational responsibilities. You'll need to have: Experience with an object-oriented programming language (preferably Python or C++). A focus on delivering good quality, well-tested, software and safely releasing it to a mission-critical production environment. A proven track record triaging and resolving live production problems. A strength in cooperating in a collaborative and inclusive team environment. The capability to work across departments, building good relationships with both technical and non-technical partners.

The team combines strategic advocacy, subject-matter expertise, and thought leadership, working closely with colleagues across Legal & Compliance, Communications, Corporate Philanthropy, and Bloomberg’s business and product teams to ensure policy engagement is aligned with broader corporate objectives. Based in Brussels, the EU team sits at the centre of Bloomberg’s engagement with the European Union’s policymaking and regulatory ecosystem. We maintain active, trusted relationships with the European Commission, European Parliament, Council, ESMA, and national competent authorities, contributing constructively to regulatory initiatives that shape European financial markets and the data, technology, and infrastructure that support them. The Opportunity Bloomberg is seeking an External Relations Manager to play a leading role in shaping and driving Bloomberg’s EU government-relations and regulatory-engagement strategy, with a strong emphasis on building, sustaining, and leveraging trusted senior relationships across EU institutions and Member States. Based in Brussels, this role sits at the centre of Bloomberg’s engagement with the EU policymaking and supervisory ecosystem. As a senior member of the EU Government Relations and Regulatory Affairs team, you will be personally accountable for cultivating long-term, high-trust relationships with senior policymakers and regulators, while providing strategic direction and senior-level advice on complex regulatory issues at the intersection of financial markets, data, and technology.

What You’ll Do: Support the external engagement priorities of the senior team in Brussels, as well as internal partners (Legal, Compliance, Communications, Marketing, Corporate Philanthropy, and business leadership) to ensure a coordinated, consistent, and relationship-focused approach. Drive Bloomberg’s senior-level EU government-relations and regulatory-engagement strategy, with a clear focus on relationship-building, trust, and long-term influence rather than transactional engagement. Build, deepen, and maintain durable, high-trust relationships with senior officials across EU institutions (European Commission, European Parliament, Council), ESAs (including ESMA), national competent authorities, and key Member State stakeholders, positioning Bloomberg as a credible, constructive, and long-term partner. Act as a primary senior point of contact for EU policymakers and regulators, ensuring continuity, institutional memory, and strategic coherence in Bloomberg’s engagement over time. Set strategic priorities and engagement plans across EU financial-services and data regulation, including market structure (MiFID II/MiFIR), transparency regimes, trading venues, capital markets, the Savings and Investments Union (SIU), benchmarks, digital finance, sustainable finance disclosures, and AI-related regulation. Provide trusted, senior-level counsel to Bloomberg’s leadership, business, and product teams on regulatory developments, political dynamics, and supervisory risk, informed by close, ongoing engagement with policymakers and regulators. Lead Bloomberg’s regulatory and policy positioning, overseeing the development of high-quality consultation responses, position papers, briefings, and engagement materials that support and reinforce Bloomberg’s relationship-based approach. Represent Bloomberg in senior external settings, including high-level regulatory roundtables, expert groups, and industry fora, using these platforms to strengthen relationships and reinforce Bloomberg’s credibility and influence. Design and deliver targeted, relationship-driven engagement initiatives, including senior-level meetings, small-group roundtables, and strategic stakeholder programmes in Brussels and other key European financial centres. Contribute to broader External Relations leadership, helping to embed a culture of long-term relationship-building and institutional trust across Bloomberg’s EU engagement. What You’ll Bring: 10+ years’ experience in EU government relations, regulatory affairs, or financial-services policy, with a strong track record of building and sustaining senior-level relationships within EU institutions, supervisory authorities, and Member States. Deep expertise in EU financial-markets regulation, particularly market structure and transparency, combined with a practical understanding of how regulatory outcomes are shaped through sustained engagement. An established, credible network across EU institutions and key national authorities, and the ability to expand and strengthen that network on behalf of the firm. Strong political and institutional judgement, including the ability to read stakeholder dynamics, manage sensitive relationships, and engage effectively in complex regulatory environments. Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the confidence to engage senior policymakers, regulators, and internal executives as a trusted counterpart. Comfort operating in senior, matrixed, international environments, balancing relationship management with strategic delivery.

    "title": "Senior Software Engineer Ticker Plant Frankfurt",
    "description": "The Ticker Plant system is the beating heart of Bloomberg’s market data infrastructure and is responsible for the storage and distribution of all Market Data within Bloomberg. Market Data is information -- trades, quotes, and other pricing data -- gathered from around the world on every possible kind of financial instrument, from stocks and bonds to currencies and commodities, and other trading venues across the globe. In the aggregate, this amounts to several hundreds of billions of events across 100 million instruments.  Read our blog to know more! Our Teams Ticker Plant is organized into the following functional areas. Market Data Distribution handles the movement of real-time market data in and out of the Ticker Plant system.  This group owns and develops infrastructure that carries hundreds of billions of events originating from across thousands of machines spanning hundreds of clusters with low latency.  In addition to the distribution infrastructure, this group provides sharding infrastructure that enables horizontal scalability of the Ticker Plant. Database Infrastructure develops a high performance time-series database that supports low latency data storage and retrieval for high-volume applications, and stores all Market Data at Bloomberg. The storage engine hosts several petabytes of data, across hundreds of millions of instruments.  The query engine handles ~100 billion queries daily ranging from interactive queries to batch queries at very high throughputs of up to 100K QPS. Data Content area focuses on APIs, systems and services which transform, enrich, store and publish these market data events, relying on externally provided middleware and persistence technology solutions. We are looking for motivated engineers in Database Infrastructure and Market Data Distribution areas to help build the next generation Ticker Plant! Our Technology Being the core of the market data infrastructure, the Ticker Plant system by necessity is scalable, distributed, highly performant, and stable.  To be highly performant, most of the critical software is written in C++. Python is also extensively used to build auxiliary services around the critically important software and to enable automation.  In addition, we use a wide range of engineering strategies to solve problems ranging from using off the shelf software (like kafka) to implementing our own algorithms/solutions (e.g custom built database), as appropriate for the problem at hand. What we do We have some unique challenges where we not only have to optimize for scale (billions of data points, hundreds of hosts) but also for very high throughput of updates and queries, all at the same time.  As market data volume increases each year, these challenges get harder to meet with the current infrastructure and so we are re-architecting and re-writing the core parts of our system to make the system simpler and easier to scale.  Some examples are: Consolidate existing data distribution mechanisms onto a fast, loss-less, resilient market data distribution infrastructure. Improve scalability of the Ticker Plant by separating data processing and data storage layers, making them independently scalable and ultimately moving storage and query layers to cloud infrastructure. Modernize data storage technologies by adopting industry best practices What is in it for you: Hands-on experience working on large scale distributed systems Join a group in the early stages of a major system re-architecture Work on core computer science problems such as efficient data storage, data discoverability, data transmission and distribution Work with high-caliber individuals and experienced teams of engineers and management Be challenged with trying to make our system more modular and horizontally scalable We’ll trust you to: Take full ownership of technical solutions/features Design, implement, and own critical applications/components of our infrastructure stack Write quality code with automated tests Collaborate with other engineers in the team and with our CTO office & business partners You’ll need to have: Experience programming in C++/Python or other object oriented languages BS, MS, PhD in Computer Science, Engineering or related technology field or relevant boot camp experience Deep desire to learn and understand software infrastructure O ur culture: We’re proud of our culture and collaboration sits at the centre of how we operate, you’ll collaborate across teams and locations on a global scale, both virtually and in person.

SFS Climate Analytics The Climate team was formed at the start of 2023. Climate change is a global problem for which Bloomberg wants to develop leading solutions. Our goal is to publish data & show analytics that inform how firms make environment-related investments. With each of our projects, we ask “what are the climate insights for our customers?”.

We added new carbon target indicators that allow analysts to download bulk data on 25K company carbon targets. To put it all together, we are working with Index on climate alignment scores to show how a company is performing today and in the future compared to their pathway and trend emissions forecast. All of our datasets need to be transparent, accurate to the methodology, and provide as wide coverage as possible. For Climate Alignment Scores, customers want to know if their portfolio is on track to decarbonize. It helps them evaluate which companies are aligned with a benchmark pathway in terms of their GHG emissions intensity.
